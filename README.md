IS733_Week2_DataMining
In the Week2 of Data Mining Course, I have created a profile table for the breast cancer dataset attached to the repository Later I applied the code to the other dataset salaries.csv and generated the respective profile table. In the code, I checked for missing values, Null values, and duplicates for which I replaced the missingness with proper inputs and dropped the duplicates I later created a bar plot for Top10 Employee Residences In the preprocessing stage, I have created the bar plot for numeric columns. In the kernel I have mentioned each part of code with necessary comments which makes the code easier to understand.
